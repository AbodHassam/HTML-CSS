          The domestic cat[1][2] (Felis catus[2] or Felis silvestris catus[4],
          informally Felis domesticus[6][7]) is a small, usually furry, domesticated,
          carnivorous mammal. It is often called the housecat when kept as an indoor pet,[8]
          or simply the cat when there is no need to distinguish it from other felids and
          felines. Cats are valued by humans for companionship and ability to hunt vermin
          and household pests. They are primarily nocturnal.[9]

          Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with strong, flexible bodies,
          quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey.
          As crepuscular predators, cats use their acute hearing and ability to see in near
          darkness to locate prey. Not only can cats hear sounds too faint for human ears,
          they can also hear sounds higher in frequency than humans can perceive. This is
          because the usual prey of cats (particularly rodents such as mice) make high
          frequency noises, so the hearing of the cat has evolved to pinpoint these faint
          high-pitched sounds. Cats also have a much better sense of smell than humans.

          Despite being solitary hunters, cats are a social species, and cat communication
          includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (meowing, purring, trilling,
          hissing, growling and grunting) as well as pheromones and types of cat-specific
          body language.[10]
