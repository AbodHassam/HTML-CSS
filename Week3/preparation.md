Forms:
 - [Your first HTML form tutorial on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Your_first_HTML_form)
 - [Form Widgets documentation on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/The_native_form_widgets)
 - [Form Validation](https://css-tricks.com/form-validation-part-1-constraint-validation-html/)

Focus on the first article to understand the basics of how to create forms. The next article covers all of the possible form widgets. You don't need to know all of them, but skim over the article so you have familiarized yourself with what options there are. Try to focus on the first section of the form validation article. Don't worry about regular expressions looking weird and scary - we will learn more about that later and usually you can google for regular expressions to do almost everything. Towards the end some javascript is introduced - you can skip this part if you want to.
