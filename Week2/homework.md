# Homework

Some readings that may help you with your homework:
 - [Media queries](https://css-tricks.com/css-media-queries/)
 - [The 30 CSS Selectors You Must Memorize](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize--net-16048)
 - [HTML syntax](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp)
 - [Article about multiple ways to select classes and id's](https://css-tricks.com/multiple-class-id-selectors)

## Assignment:
- Recreate the website from [this design](https://imgur.com/a/1gEdR)
- The website must be responsive and as the design above is the desktop layout you will need to build it so the above design will collapse to [this mobile layout](https://imgur.com/a/shzBr) (same design, new layout).
- Make sure to approximate the given design as close as you can. Imagine that you are doing it for a customer and the customer has already approved the design, so you are not allowed to change it.
- You are allowed to find logos of your own choice, though. You can use jpg, png or even svg images. If you need help finding good quality icons you can try [Iconfinder.com](http://iconfinder.com). Keep images in a separate folder.
 - BEFORE you hand it in, read [the Style guide](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp) again and check your files against the [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

How to hand in your homework:
• Upload your homework in your Github repository. 
• Make sure to create a new folder "week2" first. 
• Your hyf-html-css/week2 should now contain an index.html and a main.css file (and the images folder)
• Share the link to your page in slack.
