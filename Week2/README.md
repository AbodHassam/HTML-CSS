## Homework Week 2

>[Here](/Week2/README.md) you find the readings you have to complete before the third lecture.

### Learning goals for this week:
```
 • Student presentations
 • Last week recap and questions
 • Responsive web development
    • Relative measurements (%, (r)em, vw)
    • Media queries
    • Positioning (absolute, relative, fixed)
    • Floating and clearing
    • Flexbox
 • How to work with the inspector
```

## Step 1: Give feedback:
- Give feedback on the application assignment of your fellow student. Please be critical but most of all give constructive feedback. If there are resources that you used and might be useful, share them.
- revisit you own application assignment and improve it with the feedback and suggestions given by one of your classmates.  

## Step 2: Read/do/watch
 
Forms:
 - [Your first HTML form tutorial on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Your_first_HTML_form)
 - [Form Widgets documentation on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/The_native_form_widgets)
 - [Form Validation](https://css-tricks.com/form-validation-part-1-constraint-validation-html/)

Focus on the first article to understand the basics of how to create forms. The next article covers all of the possible form widgets. You don't need to know all of them, but skim over the article so you have familiarized yourself with what options there are. Try to focus on the first section of the form validation article. Don't worry about regular expressions looking weird and scary - we will learn more about that later and usually you can google for regular expressions to do almost everything. Towards the end some javascript is introduced - you can skip this part if you want to.

Some readings that may help you with your homework:
 - [Media queries](https://css-tricks.com/css-media-queries/)
 - [The 30 CSS Selectors You Must Memorize](The 30 CSS Selectors You Must Memorize)
 - [HTML syntax](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp)
 - [Article about multiple ways to select classes and id's](https://css-tricks.com/multiple-class-id-selectors)

## Step 3: Assignment:
- Recreate the website from [this design](https://imgur.com/a/1gEdR)
- The website must be responsive and as the design above is the desktop layout you will need to build it so the above design will collapse to [this mobile layout](https://imgur.com/a/shzBr) (same design, new layout).
- Make sure to approximate the given design as close as you can. Imagine that you are doing it for a customer and the customer has already approved the design, so you are not allowed to change it.
- You are allowed to find logos of your own choice, though. You can use jpg, png or even svg images. If you need help finding good quality icons you can try [Iconfinder.com](iconfinder.com). Keep images in a separate folder.
 - BEFORE you hand it in, read [the Style guide](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp) again and check your files against the [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

```
How to hand in your homework:
• Upload your homework in your Github repository. 
• Make sure to create a new folder "week2" first. 
• Your hyf-html-css/week2 should now contain an index.html and a main.css file (and the images folder)
• Share the link to your page in slack.
```
